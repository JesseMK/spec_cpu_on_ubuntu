History
=======

This is a fork of the
[spec_on_ubuntu_xenial](https://github.com/sjp38/spec_on_ubuntu_xenial), which
was made to support only Ubuntu Xenial (16.04).  Yunjae has extended it to
additionally support Bionic (18.04), ad as a result this fork has made.  Note
that the previous version (spec_on_ubuntu_xenial) is deprecated.
